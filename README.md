Please run the backend first and then the frontend. This is because the frontend needs to establish a socket connection with the backend. 

Backend will run on port: 8000. 

To start the server, execute the below commands in terminal/command prompt inside backend directory:

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `node index.js`

To start the client, execute the below commands in terminal/command prompt in frontend directory:

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm start`
